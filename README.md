# C-based-Webserver
This is my first attempt at programming a webserver in purely C programming and in the linux environment.i have learnt alot from this project such as socket programming and communciataions protocol methods for client server and webserver. ie TCP.
The project consist of two files one is the tcp server and the other is the tcp client they both communicate at port 9001.When both are compile and executed the client makes a  request from the server and returns a text, indicating a succcefull communication.
